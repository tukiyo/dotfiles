Autotrash is a small python script to automatically remove
(permanently delete) trashed files. It relies on the FreeDesktop.org
Trash files for it's deletion information.

It scans the ~/.local/share/Trash/info directory and reads the .trashinfo
files to determine their deletion date. Files older then 30 days or files
matching a particular regular expression are then purged, including their
trash information file.

        INSTALLATION
It should be considered to be run as a crontab entry:

@daily  /usr/bin/autotrash -d 30

Or more frequently, but to keep disk IO down, only when there is less then 3GB of free space:

@hourly /usr/bin/autotrash --max-free 3072 -d 30

To configure this, run "crontab -e" and add one of these lines in the 
editor, then save and close the file.

If you do not know how to work with crontab, you could add it to the startup 
programs in GNOME using the menu: System -> Preferences -> Sessions

Add the program with the "+ Add" button.

This will make sure that your trash is cleaned up every time you log in.
