- Write UnitTest to check conformance with the specifications
  here: http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html

Long term / per request:
- Move to python XDG as soon as it supports Trash information files
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pyxdg
- Add an option to have it register itself with crontab ("an install yourself option").
  This would have been added already if there was a default library for this kind of
  thing. I don't want to add this using my own line parser without getting an email
  requesting this.
